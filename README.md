This project is an implementation of a 3D maze using OpenGL and GLUT. The maze is generated procedurally using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and rendered using OpenGL graphics libraries. The project includes three levels of difficulty based on grid size, along with a homepage featuring instructions, exit, start, and level selection buttons.

Features:
   1.  Procedurally generated maze using DFS algorithm
   2.  Three levels of difficulty based on grid size
   3.  First-person navigation controls
   4.  Simple and intuitive user interface with homepage
